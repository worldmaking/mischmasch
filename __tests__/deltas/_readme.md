## how to use test.js

the test script now loads a very simple scene (an LFO module w/ 2 self-connections). 
you can run test.js on its own and it will pass ```node test.js```. 

you can also pass it an optional A edit using ```node test.js --A newnode```

and also an A + B edit, i.e. ```node test.js --A newnode --B delnode```

## list of available ops for testing against the current simple scene:
- newnode
- delnode
- connection
