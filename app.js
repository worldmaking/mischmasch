/*
  Goal:

  Want to establish P2P socket connections between clients over remote network, to make a teaparty
  But we don't know in advance the IP addresses or who is online, so we use a remote broker:
  - first we connect to the remote broker and let them know our IP, name, and other stats 
  - (we should also let the broker know when we leave)
  - the broker maintains a list of such connected users
  - the broker shares with all users the connection info for all the users, including updating when users join and leave
  - users use this information to establish direct P2P connections between each other

  Migrating host model
  - broker (signal server) chooses who is host (ground truth) at any time
  - normally it would be the first to connect, but could be migrated to next partygoer if the host exits (e.g. internet dropout)
  - everyone would have a socket connection to current host, and assume that the host has the 'ground truth' for merging OTs. 

  Future: many worlds, like server rooms. Anyone can start a world and invite. The default world is open like a lobby. 
  For now just do this default world.

  Q: does it make sense to use websockets for this?
  is there a more natural framework for such networks? e.g. the BUS pattern from nanomsg?
