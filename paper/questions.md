is the separation of each world indicated visually by a membrane?
  - what happens when a world collides physically in space with another world: does it blend? does one overtake the other? 
  
is it useful to consider worlds as their own servers?
  - one way this could be advantageous is a player could spin up a local server where the OT history is not accessibble by others in the scene. This means the work could then be stored privately. could also make it so that one could set permissions on who could access/write a given world-server. 
  - what happens if you lose connection with a server? 
  - black-boxing code i.e. libraries/proprietary modules where only the inlets/outlets are exposed?
  - on-premise/off-premise (code is public only to those in a workgroup)

OT history for each world? 
  - how to indicate what world a particular delta belongs to?

the concept of running two separate patchers: they can't be connected by patchcords, but they can be connected by sends/receives (and buffer/value/dict/coll/etc)

global and local values? 

is the universe the app? the scene?
